This is my first blog post and I will start with a very simple solution for a 
problem that a I had some time ago.

In order to send a SMS to an Android Emulator you just hate to:

* open a console/terminal
* find the portnumber in the title of the emulator
* connect via telnet to the running emulator: `telnet localhost [portnumber]`
* type this: `sms send senderPhoneNumber textmessage`
